                                 nnCron
                                 ~~~~~~

nnCron is an advanced powerful scheduler, reminder, scripting
tool and automation manager. nnCron has its own (Forth-compatible) 
scripting language, it allows to use VBScript/JScript, as well as regular 
expressions and can be further extended with plug-ins.

nnCron understands cron table format (Unix) and is managed with 
easy-to-edit text crontab files. However, for those who prefer to work
in a GUI environment, the program has a graphical shell which can be
used to remove, add, edit and run tasks, set up reminders, change 
program settings.

Besides possessing the traditional scheduler features (starting programs,
displaying reminder messages and opening documents at specified time), 
nnCron also can:

  - start any program as a service
  - run tasks as a specified user
  - handle and restart so called missed tasks and reminders
  - shut down and hibernate the computer or put it into sleep mode 
    at a specified time
  - "wake up" the computer in order to run a task
  - display, hide, close, kill, minimize, maximize and hide specified
    windows to system tray
  - display messages on screen and write them in a log file
  - work with clipboard, files and registry
  - emulate keyboard input and mouse activities
  - dial and hang up
  - use the system speaker to make beeps of specified length and frequency
  - play audio files
  - sync system time
  - assign a specified priority to a process
  - terminate any running process
  - restart automatically after fatal errors
  - keep track of files, flags, windows, processes, mouse activities, 
    periods of idle time, keyboard shortcuts, getting online/off line,
    insertion of disk in a drive, presence of a host in network (ping),
    amount of free space on a disk, etc., etc.

nnCron is very reliable, tiny and easy to use application. It runs blazing
fast and offers a multitude of useful features developed in close 
cooperation with other nnCron users.
